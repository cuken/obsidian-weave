# Weave
A highly opinionated Obsidian vault template for Software Developers/Managers to get you productive fast. Heavy focus on bringing order out of chaos in the corporate world. Track your meetings, applications, contacts, and tasks and draw connections between all of them.

## Prerelease available!
Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/cuken/obsidian-weave/releases) section and download either the `Demo` or `Clean` version of Weave. Demo includes a Getting started guide as well as some sample data to show all the pieces working together.

## Feedback Please!
Weave is something I wanted to give back to the community, pulling inspiration from many others before me. (I need to add a credit section soon...). Any and all Feedback would be greatly appreciated as there is always room to improve the system.

## Feature Requests
If you would like to see something added to Weave, please create an Issue and outline what it is you need.
