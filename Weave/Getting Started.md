# Getting Started

Thank you for downloading Weave! Hopefully this vault template provides inspiration to better your tracking processes for work. This vault is **highly** oppiniated and some of the decisions within may not match your work style. Feel free to adopt the portions that work and discard the rest, everyone's perfect system will look different.

This note aims to provide you with a guided onboarding process to the layout of the vault and how each peice interconnects. A Task list is provided below for you to work through to better understand the design of the system.

Weave uses a large amount of community plugins to streamline repetitive tasks, and provide data views into the notes you generate. Further information and credit to those authors is provided in the github repo for this project.

If Weave helped you, consider giving it a star on github.

## 1 - Overview Files

At the top level of the vault we have the folders that organize our notes, and (excluding this getting started note) 3 Overview Notes to help you gain insight into the current state of your vault.

- [ ] Review [[Application Overview]]
- [ ] Review [[Contact Overview]]
- [ ] Review [[Task Overview]]

> [!tip]
> Consider "starring" the overviews that provide value to you. These overviews look at the entire vault, more targetted data views and lists are generated within notes.


## 2 - Applications

I designed Weave to help me keep track of my software development work, as well as the developers I manage. Within my team, we have several applications that we work against.
Weave uses these "Applications" to help sort your daily log, as well as track tasks and meetings pertinent to the application your supporting. 

- [ ] Change the [[Demo]] Application to something relevant to you.
- [ ] Try the Quick Add command to create a new application
	- [ ] Hit `ctrl + p`  or `command + p` and type "Application"
	- [ ] In the command pallet list you should have an option for "Template - Add Application"
	- [ ] The new Application should be generated in your Application folder
- [ ] Review [[Application Overview]] again, the new application should already be in the list

> [!warning] Lots of applications?
> If you work with a lot of applications, or need to track state on a lot of applications, you may want to set up subfolders for your applications. You can modify the Template - Add Application quick add setting to prompt you for the folder to save the application in. 

> [!important] 
> Weave uses the concept of Applications heavily in a lot of it's templates. If Applications are not relevant to what your doing, consider changing it to a high level organizable unit like "Projects" or "Initiaves". Make sure you update all relevant templates and community plugin settings with whatever you decide to use.
