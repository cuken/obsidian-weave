# Getting Started

Thank you for downloading Weave! Hopefully this vault template provides inspiration to better your tracking processes for work. This vault is **highly** oppiniated and some of the decisions within may not match your work style. Feel free to adopt the portions that work and discard the rest, everyone's perfect system will look different.

This note aims to provide you with a guided onboarding process to the layout of the vault and how each peice interconnects. A Task list is provided below for you to work through to better understand the design of the system.

Weave uses a large amount of community plugins to streamline repetitive tasks, and provide data views into the notes you generate.

## 1 - Overview Files

At the top level of the vault we have the folders that organize our notes, and (excluding this getting started note) 3 Overview Notes to help you gain insight into the current state of your vault.

- [ ] Review [[Application Overview]]
- [ ] Review [[Contact Overview]]
- [ ] Review [[Task Overview]]

> [!tip]
> Consider "starring" the overviews that provide value to you. These overviews look at the entire vault, more targetted data views and lists are generated within notes.
